# Telemetry privacy boundary

Thoth sends full tool arguments and task context only to authorization endpoints (unless you
withhold them, see "Withholding values at the source" below).
Retained HTTP and SQS telemetry uses an allowlisted minimal projection: lifecycle
fields, opaque correlation identifiers, policy codes, numeric risk evidence, and a
restricted receipt/evidence subset. Free-form arguments, context, results, errors,
explanations, receipt envelopes, and unknown metadata are not serialized.

Applications must use non-sensitive opaque values for tenant, user, agent, session,
event, action, violation, receipt, policy, and rule identifiers. The projection is
not a secret scanner and intentionally preserves those identifiers for audit
correlation.

## Advisory tool inventory

Instrumentation sends tool names, descriptions, and input-schema structure with tenant and agent IDs to your configured Thoth API. Schema `default`, `example`, `examples`, `const`, and `enum` values are removed recursively. Descriptions and other schema text may still contain sensitive information: avoid embedding secrets in tool metadata. Set `THOTH_TOOL_INVENTORY=off` to disable inventory collection without disabling runtime enforcement. Uploads run in the background and do not grant execution authority.

## Withholding values at the source (opt-in)

> Not in a published release yet: this ships in the next release of `thoth-go`.

By default the SDK sends full tool arguments and task context to the authorization endpoint
(`/v1/enforce`) so that value-based rules and outbound data checks can run. You can opt in, per client,
to withhold them with `Config.DataHandlingToolArguments` (`hash`, `redact`, `drop`) and
`Config.DataHandlingPrompts` (`hash`, `drop`), or `THOTH_DATA_HANDLING_TOOL_ARGUMENTS` and
`THOTH_DATA_HANDLING_PROMPTS`. Nothing changes when they are unset.

With a mode set, the SDK does not send tool-argument values to Thoth. It transforms them in your process
before the request is built and declares what it did in a `data_handling` field on the request.
Prompt-bearing text and long free text in the task, auth, delegation and identity-binding context and in
the request metadata get the prompts mode; identifiers there are sent as given, and so are
`SessionIntent`, `Purpose` and `DataClassification`, which you set. Telemetry (`/v1/events/batch`) is
already a minimal projection and carries no argument values in either case.

Still sent to Thoth: tool names, decisions and their evidence, key names of tool arguments (except in
`drop` mode), session ids, user ids, agent and tenant ids, timing, the tool-call sequence, and the
identifiers and labels above. `hash` values are HMAC-SHA256 keyed with a salt that stays with your client
(`THOTH_DATA_HANDLING_SALT`, else random per process); Thoth does not hold it, and equal values match only
under the same salt. A low-entropy value can be confirmed by anyone who has the salt.

Local scan findings. So rules that need values can still be answered, a client that withholds tool
arguments also scans the raw arguments in its own process (heuristic patterns, `thoth-detectors.v1`) and
sends `client_findings`: counts and categories of credentials, emails, phone numbers, SSN-shaped numbers
and confidentiality phrases, whether a path looks sensitive, one destination hostname, and recipient
domains. It never sends values, paths, the local part of an address, display names or message text. A
hostname or a recipient domain can itself be sensitive to you; set `THOTH_DATA_HANDLING_LOCAL_SCAN=off` to
send no findings. Thoth cannot verify the scan: it relies on it only if your workspace opted in and listed
the scanner's ruleset hash. A workspace that requires client findings holds every call from a client that
withholds arguments and sends none.

Effect on decisions: rules and outbound data checks that need argument values cannot run on values Thoth
does not have. A call that such a rule would examine is held for review (`STEP_UP`, reason code
`args_withheld`) rather than decided blind, and with `drop` some checks fall back on tool-name heuristics.
This option limits what Thoth receives; it does not make any statement about what your own tools, logs or
other services do with the values.
